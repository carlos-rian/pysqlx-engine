This section provides some next steps for you to continue learning about PySQLXEngine.

PySQLXEngine has some resources; among them, the query and execute methods are handy.
 

## Documentation

The methods ``.query*`` is used to execute a query that returns data, and ``.execute`` is used to execute a query that does not return data but only the number of rows affected.

Both methods have the same parameters:

* ``sql``: The SQL query to be executed.
* ``parameters``: The parameters to be passed to the query. This parameter is optional.
