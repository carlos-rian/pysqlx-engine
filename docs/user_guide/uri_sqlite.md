# Database URI

## **SQLite**

## **Connection URL**
The connection URL of a SQLite connector points to a file on your file system. For example, the following two paths are equivalent because the .db is in the same directory:

Example 1:

```text
sqlite:./dev.db
```

Example 2:

```text
sqlite:dev.db
```

Example 3:

```text
sqlite:/Users/janedoe/dev.db
```
